The finished product will be executable from the GUI via an icon

Feature that need to be added:
1. Mount NAS drives (caution with inserting passwords into code; perhaps get it to ask you for them)
2. Detect images taken so many days apart, prompt user to create separate or a single filefolder
3. Make event input read spaces
